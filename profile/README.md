## A Digital Twin for Svalbard's Cryosphere

The ‘Svalbard Cryosphere Digital Twin (SvalbardDT)’ project will build a Digital Twin Component (DTC) as part of the European Space Agency’s (ESAs) Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative to build a digital twin of the Earth. We will construct a new DTC of the ice and snow of Svalbard’s cryosphere in the 21st Century through an automated data management system to ingest, harmonise, and analyse data products ready for delivery to the Digital Twin Earth Service Platform (DESP). The DTC developed here will utilise open-source satellite data and state-of-the art physics-based models to fully describe the characteristics of snow cover, glacier mass balance, and sea ice dynamics in Svalbard and associated waters in the 21st Century. Our vision is to capture observations of relevant environmental data, across the Svalbard ‘super site’, and feed them into a self-learning spatio-temporal model to build a time series of 3D change of ice and snow in Svalbard since the turn of the century. We will build the digital infrastructure and develop the Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling methods required to build the DTC, delivering a step-change in our environmental digital twinning capabilities. The DTC will be optimised using Svalbard’s extensive observational record which will enable us to undertake a thorough validation of the DTC outputs.
